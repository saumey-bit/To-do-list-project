# To-do-list-project
This project uses the following concept:

1. **User Interface**:
   You can create a text-based interface using the console. You might want to consider using libraries like ncurses for a more interactive and user-friendly interface.

2. **Data Structure**:
   Decide on the data structure to store the to-do list items. You can use an array, vector, or linked list, depending on your preference and the complexity you want to achieve.

3. **Menu System**:
   Implement a menu system that allows users to perform actions like adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and viewing the list.

4. **File Handling**:
   You can add the ability to save and load tasks from a file. This ensures that the to-do list persists between program runs.

5. **Functionality**:
   Implement the core functionality of the to-do list:
   - Add tasks
   - View tasks
   - Mark tasks as completed
   - Delete tasks
   - Save and load tasks from a file

6. **User Input**:
   Create functions to handle user input and validate it. Make sure to handle different input cases gracefully to avoid crashes.

7. **Display List**:
   Implement functions to display the to-do list on the console. You can format it nicely for better readability.

8. **Error Handling**:
   Add error handling for cases like invalid input or file read/write errors.
